                Silvia (b 1999) is a London-based graduate with a BA in Fashion Design Womenswear from Central Saint Martins. She delights in immersing herself in unreal spaces filled with hypothetical thoughts, exploring the ability to leap between different concepts. She treats visual presentation with the same subtlety she applies to language, creating pieces that resonate on multiple levels and transcend conventional boundaries.<br><br>
                For Silvia, fashion is but one avenue of creation. She endeavours to delve not only into the fashion domain but also into interdisciplinary fields such as philosophy; her next step is fine art photography, promising to further expand her creative horizons.

                Morpews Gallery is a digital building made of rooms rather than pages, each screen a wall that listens. Inside, images are cropped, scattered, rearranged; words emerge, dissolve, return. The architecture is quiet — pale stone, dark lines — but alive with invisible labour: algorithms tend the pictures like nocturnal caretakers, and every visitor's gesture rewrites the air. Here, containment and dispersion live side by side: a single, restless mosaic in Glassworks; an ever-expanding firmament in Constellations. Together they form a house where fragments seek their reflections and stories slip, understated, through the seams.
