                <span class="citation-text">Silvia (b 1999) is a London-based graduate with a BA in Fashion Design Womenswear from Central Saint Martins. She delights in immersing herself in unreal spaces filled with hypothetical thoughts, exploring the ability to leap between different concepts. She treats visual presentation with the same subtlety she applies to language, creating pieces that resonate on multiple levels and transcend conventional boundaries. For Silvia, fashion is but one avenue of creation. She endeavours to delve not only into the fashion domain but also into interdisciplinary fields such as philosophy; her next step is fine art photography, promising to further expand her creative horizons.</span>

                <span class="citation-text">Each photograph enters as a shard of broken mirror, cold and lucid; the AI — an austere watchman — trims its edges and slides it into a widening mosaic, the way frost settles pane by pane across a window. With every shift the image-world reforms like clear glass melting back to unity, and the machine, turning briefly tender, releases spare lines of poetry that hover over the scene. The site remains a quiet chamber where fragments search for their lost reflections, and where word and picture, shy but inexorable, keep rewriting the silence between them.</span>
